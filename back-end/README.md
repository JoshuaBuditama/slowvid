Install the project with

```
npm install
```

Run the dev server with:

```
npm start
```

You can always trash the install and start fresh with:

```
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.


## Conventions

### 1. camelCase

For variable, class and package names, prefer camelCase to kebab-case, snake_case or any other naming convention. 


### 2. prefer npm over yarn

Yarn is another common javascript package manager. 
We'll run into less issues if everyone uses npm.
